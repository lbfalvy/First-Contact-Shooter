# First-Contact-Shooter

No gravity, no point, direction or velocity of reference just you and your target.
And delta-V. Probably lots of delta-V. Since our astronauts aren't expected to
know rocket science, your fighter comes packed with a basic autopilot that can track certain targets and brake relative to them. this can come handy when you
want to engage in combat for more than a split second. Keep in mind though that
the autobrake can only decelerate so fast as you can accelerate, so start braking 
early. Halfway there, to be precise. You'll probably screw this up at first anyway.
In case you don't die in the process, see you on the battlefields.

## Current state of the game

This is a game of real-time strategy, reflexes and precision. Or, rather, it could
be. For now it's just an optimistic model of certain parts of a spaceship, a
projectile-based gun and an autopilot. It's kinda fun to play though. In the
current setup with the killzone being so small, you should probably start braking
somewhere between .5 and .7 km from the core.

## Collaboration

If you have an idea, I'd love to hear it, but you're also perfectly free to fork
or just simply reuse the scripts. If you find a bug, create a pull request.
